    <h3>Selectors Challenge</h3>

    <div>
        <p>class="salim">"Learning CSS selectors is like unlocking the hidden power of web design. First, element
            selectors let you
            style all
            &lt;p&gt; or &lt;h1&gt;
            tags in a page at once. Second, class selectors allow you to target groups of
            elements that share
            the same
            purpose,
            such as buttons or cards. Third, ID selectors focus on a single unique element, perfect for headers or
            special
            sections. Fourth, combinators help you style elements based on their relationships, like parent > child or
            sibling +
            sibling. Fifth, pseudo-classes let you add effects like hover, focus, or active states to make interactions
            dynamic.
            Sixth, pseudo-elements like ::first-letter or ::before add creative touches to text or content. Seventh,
            attribute
            selectors can target elements with specific properties, such as inputs with a certain type or links with a
            specific
            href. Finally, understanding specificity ensures your styles are applied exactly where you want them,
            avoiding
            conflicts and making your designs clean and professional."</p>
